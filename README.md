DoEFI
==================
This command makes it easy to mount the EFI right away when installing Opencore or Clover to run Hackintosh for example.
well... Im so sorry maybe the construction can be very simple and sloppy.

## How to install and use DoEFI

1. Open "Install" and if u wanna use Doefi, agree for install doefi.　Now, by design, you have to restart the terminal. Therefore, if there is any other work in progress, please finish it before installing, or execute it in a separate tab.

2. Type `doefi [OPTON]`.

   Mount EFI > `doefi -m`
   Unmount EFI > `doefi -u`

   This command is need " Root (su) "
